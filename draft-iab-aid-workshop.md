--- abstract

The 'Show me the numbers: Workshop on Analyzing IETF Data (AID)' was convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the IN-SIGHT.it project at the University of Amsterdam in November and December 2020. This report summarized the workshop's significant points of discussion and identifies topics that may warrant future work and consideration.

# Introduction

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) regularly organizes workshops designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The IETF as an international Standards Developing Organization hosts diverse data on the history, development, and current activities in the development and standardization of Internet protocols and its institutions. A large portion of this data is publicly available, yet this data is arguably underutilized as a tool to inform the work in the IETF and research on topics like Internet governance and trends in ICT standard-setting.

The aim of this workshop was to analyze how IETF data currently is used, what insights can be drawn from that, and what questions that are worth pursuing remain unanswered. These questions could inform a research agenda for IETF data for collaborative work among interested parties, ranging from academia and civil society to industry and IETF leadership. 

# Workshop Scope and Discussion

## Tools, data, and methods

The IETF holds a wide range of data sources. The main ones used are the [mailinglist archives](), [RFCs](), and [the datatracker](). The latter provides information on participants, authors, meeting proceedings, minutes [and more](). Furthermore there are [statistics for the IETF websites](), working group Github repositories, IETF [survey data](). 

There are a wide range of tools to analyze this data, produced by IETF participants or researchers interestested in the work of the IETF. Two projects that presented their work at the workshop were [BigBang](https://bigbang-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and Sodestream's [IETFdata](https://github.com/lumisota/ietfdata) library. These projects could be used to add additional insights to the existing [IETF statistics](https://www.arkko.com/tools/docstats.html) page and the [datatracker statistics](https://datatracker.ietf.org/stats/)
